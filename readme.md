# CSS-Battle-Solutions

This GitHub repository is dedicated to showcasing my solutions for various challenges on [CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev/). CSS Battle is a platform that offers coding challenges to test and improve your CSS skills.

## Challenges

The repository contains individual solutions for each CSS Battle challenge that I have completed. 

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference or inspiration for your own CSS Battle challenges. Each solution is a standalone HTML file that demonstrates the specific styling and layout techniques used to solve the corresponding challenge.


## Contributing

If you are also a CSS Battle enthusiast and would like to contribute your own solutions, you are welcome to do so! Simply create a pull request with your solution file added to the `solutions` directory. Please make sure to follow the existing structure and naming conventions for consistency.

However, it's important to note that CSS Battle challenges are designed to be solved individually, and the primary goal is to enhance your CSS skills through problem-solving. Therefore, avoid directly copying existing solutions. Instead, use this repository as a resource to learn and improve your CSS abilities.

I hope you find these solutions helpful and inspiring for your own CSS Battle journey. Happy coding!
