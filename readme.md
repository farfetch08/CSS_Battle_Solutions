## Contributing

If you would like to contribute your own solutions, feel free to create a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing structure and add your solution file to the `solutions` directory.

Please note that CSS Battle challenges are meant to be solved individually, so avoid copying existing solutions directly. Instead, use this repository to learn and improve your CSS skills.ðŸ™ƒ
